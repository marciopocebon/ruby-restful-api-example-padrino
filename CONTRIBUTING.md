# Contributing
***
1. Fork it
2. Create your feature branch (```git checkout -b my-new-feature```)
3. Commit your changes (```git commit -am 'Added some feature'```)
4. Push to the branch (```git push origin my-new-feature```)
5. Create new Pull Request

## Guidelines:
- **Write unit tests:** If you add or modify functionality, it must include unit tests. If you don't write tests, we have to, and this can hold up acceptance of the patch.

- **Mind the README:** If the patch adds or modifies a major feature, modify the README.md file to reflect that. Again, if you don't update the README, we have to, and this holds up acceptance.
