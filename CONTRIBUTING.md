## Guidelines (with ideias from [sinatra](https://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)):
- *Write unit tests:* If you add or modify functionality, it must include unit tests. If you don't write tests, we have to, and this can hold up acceptance of the patch.

- *Mind the README:* If the patch adds or modifies a major feature, modify the README.md file to reflect that. Again, if you don't update the README, we have to, and this holds up acceptance.
